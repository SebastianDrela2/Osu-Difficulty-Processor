## Usage Instruction

- Run the solution
- Fill in expected fields
- Wait till operation completes.

_Note: In my opinion API fetch value should be set to 1 second, this is so you dont overload OSU API on large beatmap sets._


**IMPORTANT** Osu API maps can be updated more frequently than those you store locally, because of this sometimes a mapname will be not found in local files,
However map's that are not copied but count as a hit are still saved in a seperate txt file.
