## Usage Instruction

- Run the solution
- Fill in expected fields
- Wait till operation completes.

_Note: In my opinion API fetch value should be set to 1 second, this is so you dont overload OSU API on large beatmap sets._


**IMPORTANT** Osu tends to update their API not as frequently as maps are updated on the site itself, this can result in hits that are not copied 
_map does not match the map name in the API_
